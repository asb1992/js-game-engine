# js-game-engine
This is a pretty big project for me. I've worked on it in some form or another since high school, just for fun.

It uses box2d.js as its physics engine. This is a port of the Box2D engine originally written in C++.
charMap.js is a mapping between game objects and their physical and in-game properties.
index.php lists out the levels in the levels directory.
ball.php is what kicks off the main game loop. The logic is contained in main.js, in the js folder.
edit.html is a simple level editor. Be warned: I wrote this a long time ago, and the PHP code I use to save levels is likely not safe for any kind of public use.
