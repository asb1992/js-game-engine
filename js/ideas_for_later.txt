Would have included, but doesn't fit well currently. No reason to have nighttime yet.

function cycleNight(layer) {
	
	if (!(layer.style.opacity))      {layer.style.opacity = 0;}
	if (layer.counter === undefined) {layer.counter = -400;}
	
	layer.style.opacity = Math.sin( (Math.PI * layer.counter) / 720 ) / 1.5;
	
	layer.counter += 1;
	
}
